            <h2> Dashboards (AGOL) </h2>
            <h3> Overview </h3>
            <p> 
            ArcGIS Dashboards are a solution to present spatial information in a simple format. 
            </p>
            <p> 
            Dashboards can display ArcGIS Onlines Scenes similar to how they display Webmaps. 
            </p>
            <img src="img/Dashboard.png" alt="Screenshot of Dashboard with Scene" class="imgs">
            <p> 
            In the Dashboard, Scenes can be interactive. For example, there are pop-ups on the data points. Also, they have the ability to make selecting surrounding elements create actions on the scene and other surrounding elements.
            </p>
            <img src="img/DashboardPopup.png" alt="Vector Data analysis" class="imgs">
            <p> 
            When items on the List element are selected. It is reflected in the chart and scene. 
            </p>
            <img src="img/DashboardListSelected.png" alt="Vector Data analysis" class="imgs">
            <p> 
            When items on the Chart element are selected. It is reflected in the list and scene. 
            </p>
            <img src="img/DashboardChartSelected.png" alt="Vector Data analysis" class="imgs">
            <p> 
            One notable difference in having a scene in a dashboard rather than a webmap is an action can't be created to cause the surrounding elements to change based on what is in the view on the scene.
