                    During our studies at Fleming College, all members of our team have gained a basic understanding of database principles. This includes an understanding of database structure, how tables relate to one another 
                    within data models, how reliable data transactions occur, and how to plan efficient databases. As well, we have learned basic data normalization principles that prevent the unnecessary duplication of data and allow 
                    for easy information retrieval. We have also learned how to use the SQL programming language to manipulate data within Microsoft Access
